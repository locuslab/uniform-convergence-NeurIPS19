    "In order to take a principled approach towards improving our algorithms, we must first have a good understanding of why they work as well as they do. And in this regard, our understanding of generalization in deep learning\n",
    "is quite inadequate: one would expect excessively overparameterized deep networks trained using an algorithm as plain as stochastic gradient descent to rote-learn the labeling on the training set, and classify unseen inputs arbitrarily. Yet, such an approach learns something much cleverer. Why is this so?\n",
    "Answering this question  has clearly become an active area of research in the past few years, with a whole [workshop in ICML](https://sites.google.com/view/icml2019-generalization/home) dedicated to this (and its related questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "To theoretically study the generalization behavior of a model, one must derive upper bounds on the gap between the error of the model on test data (unseen data) and the training data (assuming that they are all drawn i.i.d from the same data distribution). Recall that such bounds typically take the following form:\n",

    "compute the \"some complexity term\" by considering a _uniform convergence_ bound on the class of functions representable by a deep network. We will define what this means more formally later, but for now recall that when we \"apply uniform convergence\" on a class of functions, we basically compute how \"representationally rich\" the function class is. This approach is already known to fail miserably in deep learning [[Neyshabur et al., 2015]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6614) [[Zhang et al., 2017]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530). This is because the same deep network that generalizes well on a nice dataset, can also be shown to be representationally rich enough to fit noisy labels on that dataset. In mathematical terms, standard uniform convergence bounds fail because they resolve to something like:\n",

Specifically, the proposal was to \"search for the inductive bias\" of SGD in deep learning: can we identify how the underlying data distribution and the algorithm  in conjuction restrict the deep network to a \"simple\" class of functions? Mathematically, can we find weight norms that are implicitly regularized during training on real data? Then, we could apply uniform convergence on a correspondingly simpler, norm-bounded class of functions, which would then hopefully yield better bounds. Roughly, these bounds would be of the form:\n",

    "span many different learning-theoretic techniques: PAC-Bayes, Rademacher complexity, covering numbers, compression.

However, these aspects are only one part of the story; there is another significant and equally non-trivial part of the puzzle that has received much less attention: that of training-dataset-size-dependence.

    "We focus on three generalization bounds: the PAC-Bayesian bound from [Neyshabur et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09564), the covering number bound from [Bartlett et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08498), and the Rademacher complexity bound from [Neyshabur et al., 2019](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BygfghAcYX). Although we focus only on these three, our observations extend to other bounds as well. This is because all other bounds depend on norms that appear in these bounds -- like the spectral norm or the distance from initialization -- which grow with dataset size, as we will see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above generalization bounds can be written as follows, ignoring some minor variations. For any training input $(x,y)$ (where $x$ is the feature vector and $y \\in \\{1,2,... K\\}$ is the class label), let $f(x)[k] \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be the output of the network on class $k$.\n",
    "If $\\mathcal{D}$ denotes the underlying data distribution, and $S$ the training set of $m$ datapoints, then, for any $\\gamma \\geq 0$, we can upper bound the test error as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\begin{eqnarray}\\underbrace{Pr_{(x,y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}[f(x)[y] < \\max_{y \\neq k} f(x)[k]]}_{\\text{test 0-1 error}}  \\leq & \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{(x,y) \\in S} \\mathbf{1}[f(x)[y]  < \\max_{y \\neq k} f(x)[k]{\\color{red} +} {\\color{red} \\gamma}]}_{\\text{proportion of training points misclassified by a \"margin\" of } \\gamma} \\\\ & + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\text{some weight norms}}{ {\\color{red} \\gamma} \\sqrt{m}}\\right)\n",

    "In other words, the 0-1 test error is upper bounded by a stronger measure of error on the training set -- a margin-based error -- and a term that grows with the weight norms of the network. Both these terms depend on $\\gamma$ which is a knob that we are free to tune in this guarantee in order to obtain the best generalization bound. (Note that this must be tuned carefully to achieve a good tradeoff: for large $\\gamma$, the first term on the right is large and for small $\\gamma$, the second term is large).\n",

Perhaps, by choosing larger values of $\\gamma$, one can make the last term in the generalization bound (the one we have plotted above)  smaller since it has $\\gamma$ in the denominator. Let us take this hope \"to the extreme\" by setting $\\gamma$ to be the _median margin_ of the network on the training data.\n",
    "That is, we enumerate the value of $f(x)[y] - \\max_{y \\neq k} f(x)[k]$ for every training point $(x,y)$ and then pick the median value of this quantity. We call this $\\gamma_{\\text{median}}$. Then, the generalization bound would look like:\n",

    "\n",
    " _Existing norm-based generalization guarantees (falsely) indicate that, as we add more datapoints to the training set, the network simply memorizes these datapoints.  Therefore, to truly understand generalization in deep learning, it is not only important to derive parameter-count-independent generalization guarantees, but also important to derive bounds whose dataset-size-dependence reflects that of the actual generalization error, at least to a reasonable extent._ \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by the fact that existing bounds have a hard time meeting the criteria for explaining generalization (appropriate paramter-count-dependence, datasize-dependence etc.,), in this section, we will investigate the theoretical technique underlying _all_ these bounds (PAC-Bayes, Rademacher, VC, covering numbers, compression etc.,): uniform convergence. Specifically, we will show through examples that _any_ uniform convergence bound, however tightly it is applied, fails to explain generalization in SGD-trained neural networks.\n",

    "Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be an underlying distribution from which the training set $S$ of $m$ examples is drawn i.i.d. Assume we have an algorithm that, when given the dataset $S$, outputs a hypothesis $h_S$ that is picked from a hypothesis class $H$. (Throughout our discussion we assume that $h_S$ has zero error on $S$.) For any $h$, we let $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(h)$ denote the test error of $h$ (expected error over $\\mathcal{D}$) and $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_S(h)$ the average empirical error over the dataset $S$.\n",

For example, what if we restrict the supremum to a single hypothesis? Unfortunately, while that may yield an encouragingly small bound, it would not be a valid upper bound on $\\epsilon_{\\text{gen}}$.

    "We observe that even though the test error decreases with dataset size, the error on $S'$ remains constant at (or almost near) $1.00$, implying that $\\epsilon_{\\text{unif}}^{\\star}$ is vacuous. Note that we did not explicitly modify the training in any way to make the network misclassify $S'$. It just so happens that SGD trains the network in a particular way that leads to misclassification of $S'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the misclassification of $S'$ means that the learned decision boundary near each training datapoint is skewed all the way into the opposite class, resulting in the closest point from the opposite class to be misclassified (visualized in 2D below). This also means that the learned decision boundary  is \"complex\" enough to \"memorize\" the locations of the training data (although at the same time, the decision boundary generalizes well).\n",

    "- the decision boundary is \"macroscopically simple\", leading to good generalization.\n",
    "- at the same time, the complex skews in the decision boundary are only \"microscopic\" (i.e., they  cover only low probability regions in the input space). Since they are microscopic, the skews will not affect the generalization error. However, uniform convergence, even the cleverest version of it, is not clever enough to ignore these skews, as encapsulated by Lemma 1. \n",

    "#### Near the training set\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we visualize these boundaries in the hypersphere dataset by consider 2D slices of the high-dimensional space.\n",
    "Specifically, we pick pairs of training datapoints, and consider the 2D plane that contains these two points and then plot the learned boundary on this plane. The region classified as belonging to the inner hypersphere is colored brown, and the other blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, observe the curvature of the boundary _right near_ each training datapoint. If the training datapoint is on the inner sphere, the boundary near the point juts out all the way into the outer sphere; if it is on the outer sphere, the boundary near the point is tightly squeezed within the inner sphere. This leads to misclassification of the projected versions of these training datapoints.\n"

For example, imagine we are able argue why the  \"bad\" sub-component of the deep network does not affect the network's output (on most inputs). Perhaps, the remaining, \"good\" sub-component does yield tight uniform convergence bounds after all (similar to existing tight bounds on stochastic/compressed networks).

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we observe these plots even for squared error loss; we present these plots in the appendix; we also refer the reader to plots in  [Nagarajan and Kolter 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01672).\n",
    "Secondly, we must emphasize that margin-based generalization bounds do take care of \"scaling down\" networks that have been trained to minimize cross-entropy loss. Recall that these bounds have the following form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\underbrace{Pr_{(x,y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}[f(x)[y] < \\max_{y \\neq k} f(x)[k]]}_{\\text{test 0-1 error}} \\leq & \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{(x,y) \\in S} \\mathbf{1}[f(x)[y] < \\max_{y \\neq k} f(x)[k]{\\color{red}+} {\\color{red}\\gamma}]}_{\\text{proportion of training points misclassified by a \"margin\" of } \\gamma}\\\\& + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\text{some weight norms}}{ {\\color{red}\\gamma} \\sqrt{m}}\\right)\\end{align}$$\n",

At the same time, in the second term on the right hand side, such a large $\\gamma$ in the denominator would hopefully counter the large magnitudes of the weights in the numerator.

Our guess is that this sort of an increase would be observed until the setting becomes underparameterized. In some sense, as we add more and more data, a small part of the decision boundary becomes skewed (adding more complexity, increasing the norm); the number of such skews should be bounded by the maximum capacity of the model -- the parameter-count.\n",

And so, if not for these outlier examples, the network will probably not exhibit such a behavior, and uniform convergence may indeed hold in that case.__\n",

The examples in this paper, where uniform convergence is shown to fail, critically depend on the fact that the definition of uniform convergence is two-sided i.e., the bound is on the _absolute_ value of the difference between the test error and the empirical error. So can't we circumvent the problem in these examples by using one-sided uniform convergence bounds?__\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

Although PAC-Bayes bounds hold simultaneously across all stochastic classifiers (for a given dataset draw), for each stochastic classifier, it yields a different numerical value specific to that classifier. However, the definition of uniform convergence in this paper corresponds to just a single numerical value that holds for all the classifiers output by the algorithm. Given this disparity, do PAC-Bayes bounds really fit the definition of uniform convergence in this paper? In other words, do the examples in this paper really apply to PAC-Bayes bounds too?__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__A:__ This is a subtle point and requires a detailed answer. We argue why our definition applies to PAC-Bayes bounds too, at least, the deterministic/derandomized ones. \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{w.h.p of }1-\\delta\\text{ over }S\\sim\\mathcal{D}^m,\\text{for all stochastic classifiers Q}, \\\\ |\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{D}}(Q) - \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{\\mathcal{S}}(Q) | \\leq \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\text{some complexity of }Q}{\\sqrt{m}}\\right)$$\n",

    "In practice, one usually reports the right hand side evaluated for a specific classifier $Q$ centered at the weights learned by SGD for a particular draw of $S$ (this is true even of most other bounds, not just PAC-Bayes bounds). Even though such a bound may be a practically interesting quantity, strictly speaking, such a bound in itself is not a theoretically rigorous upper bound on the test error of the learned hypothesis. This is because, the above statement does not guarantee whether the \"w.h.p over $S$\" includes the training set that we just drew. Hence, we would not know whether the upper bound in this statement holds for the difference between the test error and empirical error on the particular dataset $S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one way to get a rigorous, valid generalization bound from the above statement and that would be a bound \n",
    "that holds for the algorithm itself and not a specific classifier. To derive this, we must\n",
    "first compute the right hand side for many independent draws of the dataset $S$ (upto at least $1-\\delta$ probability mass of them). Then, we will be able to safely guarantee that the maximum of the values obtained across these datasets, is an upper bound on $\\epsilon_{\\text{gen}}$, the generalization error of the algorithm (i.e., an upper bound that holds for not just one hypothesis, but for almost all hypotheses output by the algorithm). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in effect, for a valid generalization bound, we will have to compute the supremum of the PAC-Bayesian bound over multiple different hypotheses relevant to the algorithm.

    "\n",
    "__A:__ This is a clever question and demands a detailed answer. Recall that in a data-dependent uniform convergence bound, the supremum over the hypothesis space $H^\\star$ is replaced by a hypothesis set $H_S$ that is dependent on $S$ and hopefully smaller than the data-independent $H^\\star$:\n",

These bounds essentially define $H_S$ to be the set of hypotheses with bounded data-dependent norms (like the $\\ell_2$ norms of the Jacobians). This kind of characterization does not exclude \"bad\" hypotheses from $H_S$ which impair uniform convergence (as in, there is no reason why the bad hypotheses for a particular dataset, would not satisfy these Jacobian-norm bounds).

For example, in [Dziugate and Roy., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.11008) the network is modified by adding noise, besides explicitly optimizing it further to reduce a PAC-Bayesian bound.

    "\n",
    "__A:__ Indeed, when the spheres are far apart, the neural network achieves near-zero test error; thus, the projected dataset $S'$ will no longer be misclassified, and $\\epsilon_{\\text{unif}}^\\star$ is probably zero too. Furthermore, if we stop the network quite early, the test error may still be small and the dataset $S'$ may no longer be misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this does not make our examples restrictive. This is because our lower bound is on a _really_ powerful uniform convergence bound (namely, $\\epsilon_{\\text{unif}}^\\star$) that has complete knowledge of the underlying data distribution $\\mathcal{D}$. And to show that even this powerful bound fails, we do need such closely placed class distributions and train the network for a sufficiently long time. Intuitively, we want the class boundaries of the network to fall within the tiny \"skews\" around the training data, to bring about the failure of uniform convergence. And to make these skews sufficiently large in practice, one needs to bring the classes closer and train longer. (Note that we do not _artificially_ create these skews by modifying the learning algorithm. These skews are solely a creation of vanilla SGD; we simply \"rescale\" the environment in a way that makes observing these skews better!\n",

    "Most implementations of uniform convergence (such as those applied for MNIST) do not make any assumptions about the underyling data beyond simple assumptions like bounds on the $\\ell_2$ norm of the data. Our intuition is that, even when the classes are far apart, one can still find skews in the decision boundary -- just that they may not leak into the opposite class. However, weakly-distribution-dependent uniform-convergence bounds would still perceive these skews as overfit to the training data, and hence fail in these cases. \n",

    "Now,  even if we did use our knowledge of the underlying distribution to apply uniform convergence in these cases (say, we assume a specific underlying data distribution), we believe that tools which implement uniform convergence -- like  Rademacher complexity or PAC-Bayes bounds -- are not  sophsticated enough to ignore such skews. We would have to explicitly ignore these skews (and argue why they don't affect the generalization error) and then apply these tools only on the modified network (which is basically what we propose for future work). \n",

While our neural network examples concretely establish failure of uniform convergence in deep learning, we hope that the linear example provides some intuition into the _mechanism_ by which uniform convergence fails, from which we can draw intuition about deep learning keeping in mind the recently established similarities to linearized deep networks [[Jacot et al., 2018]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572). \n",

    "Let us do a quick recap of the mechanism by which uniform convergence fails in our linear example. In this example, there are many more features than training datapoints, and most of these features are useless. The learned classifier inadvertently assigns some weights to these useless features. Now, although the weights corresponding to these meaningless features do not contribute to the classifier's output on most test inputs, they do affect the output in small parts of the input space. We show how this results in a complex decision boundary, leading to failure of uniform convergence without hurting generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, recall that under some conditions, in the infinite-width setting, deep learning models can be thought of as overparameterized linearized model whose features can be computed from the outputs of the random initialization of the network [[Jacot et al., 2018]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572). (In other words, these models can be thought of as random features models). Our intuition is that most directions in this random features space are meaningless. Like in our linear example, although gradient descent probably adds a lot of weight to the useful features, it also inadvertently adds some weight to the meaningless features, which result in complex error regions, without hurting generalization. \n",

    "__Q. Didn't [Zhang et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530) already prove these negative results about uniform convergence?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__A.__ No, [Zhang et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530) showed that the standard application of uniform convergence (which is an extremely naive application) over the whole space of functions represented by a deep network is vacuous. They suggested that, perhaps, applying uniform convergence on smaller class of function relevant to SGD, may yield meaningful bounds. Subsequently, many papers attempted this in one way or the other. Our result argues that even this kind of approach would be futile in deep learning because uniform convergence is fundamentally weaker in other intricate ways  for deep learning models. \n",

    "__Q. Isn't uniform convergence already known to fail in kNNs?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__A.__ Indeed the VC dimension of kNNs is known to be infinite, as a result of which algorithmic stability based techniques are used to study generalization in these models. However this intuition in a non-parametric model does not  extend to parameteric models trained by gradient descent. Furthermore, we rigorously show how even the tightest algorithm-dependent & distribution-dependent uniform convergence can fail even when the algorithm has small test/train error (and this sort of intuition for kNN models is only folklore wisdom to the best of our knowledge).\n",

    "__Q. Didn't [Shalev-Shwartz et al.,](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953019) show that uniform convergence provably fails in some cases?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__A.__ Their result is _completely_ orthogonal to ours (i.e., neither stronger, nor weaker, nor equivalent). In formal terms, their work is about showing that for \"a learning problem\", it is possible for (a distribution-independent version of) uniform convergence to not hold even though the problem is \"learnable\". The notions of \"a learning problem\" and \"learnability\" are formal terms that are not relevant to our discussion in this paper. Roughly speaking, a learning problem is defined solely by a hypothesis class and a loss function (like the 0-1 error) -- but not by the underlying data distribution. And if the learning problem is learnable, it means that there is __some__ learning rule  such that, for __all__ underlying data distributions, the learning rule uses the training data to pick a near-optimal hypothesis from the hypothesis class.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Shalev-Shwartz et al.,](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953019) show that \"uniform convergence does not imply learnability of a general learning problem\". Specifically, they construct a\n",
    "stochastic optimization problem (_not_ a binary classification problem) for which, even though there exists a learning rule that picks a near-optimal hypothesis (from the given hypothesis class) for all complex data distributions, distribution __independent__\n",
    "uniform convergence does not hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as binary classification problems are concerned [Shalev-Shwartz et al.,](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1953019) themselves note that uniform convergence is equivalent to learnability in binary classification problems.\n",
    "On the other hand, our result establishes an orthogonal negative link between uniform convergence and binary classification. Specifically, we show for a binary classification task that, for the __particular__ learning rule of gradient descent, and for a __particular simple__ class of distributions, even though the learning rule picks a good hypothesis, even distribution __dependent__ and algorithm-dependent uniform convergence fails.\n",

    "__Q. Previous works like [Belkin et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01396) have studied interpolation (i.e., training models to zero squared error loss). Doesn't this already show that norms grow with dataset size in overparameterized models?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__A.__  We extend this observation in two crucial ways. First [Belkin et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01396) show that in kernel learning,\n",
    "_when the labels are corrupted with non-zero amounts of noise_, the kernel norms (that\n",
    "appear in kernel generalization bounds) increase with dataset size. Now, it is\n",
    "reasonable to expect that, when the model is forced to fit more and more noise (with\n",
    "more and more training data), it must increase its capacity to memorize such\n",
    "information – resulting in larger norms. What happens when there is no noise in the\n",
    "labels? We show that even when there is no label noise, the norms (and also the generalization bounds) can increase adversely, which is much more concerning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important distinction is that [Belkin et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01396) conduct their experiments on the squared error loss, while we study the cross-entropy loss. When minimizing the squared-error loss, the network is forced to reproduce the _exact_ real-value of the labels at the training datapoints. This is significantly harder than what it is expected to do under cross-entropy loss: simply reproduce the _sign_ of these labels. Hence, it is more surpising that even for this easy goal, the norms of a network grow as it is made to fit (the signs) of the labels of of more and more training datapoints.\n",

    "Although one can see that the norms increase with dataset size in those plots, their \n",

    "More specifically, although these previous plots demonstrate that the norms increase with dataset size, it is not clear if this increase is concerningly large enough to affect the generalization bounds (since there is a $\\sqrt{\\text{training set size}}$ factor in the denominator of these bounds). We demonstrate that there do exist certain hyperparameter settings where the generalization bounds are affected adversely (despite the $\\sqrt{\\text{training set size}}$ in the denominator). We also take a closer look at this phenomenon by optimizing the margin parameter in these bounds (see <a href=\"#median-margin\">experiments on median margins</a>) and by studying other related phenomena like pseudo-overfitting (not covered in our blog).\n",
